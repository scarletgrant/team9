NOTE FOR TEAM: renamed 'id' (as defined in UML diagram) to 'station_number_in_contract'. JCDecaux notes that this number is not an id,
so we should consider to adjust that in our UML and create a new unique key in the database with number and contractname combined for example.

STATION.PY
The station class creates object instances of the class station to define the retreived data from JCDeacaux regarding their stations.

@parameters:

Document name conventions:  Data type:   Naming by JCDecaux:
Static data:
station_number_in_contract  integer       - number: number of the station. This is NOT an id, thus it is unique only inside a contract.
contract_name               string        - contract_name: name of the contract of the station
name                        string        - name: name of the station
address                     string        - address: address of the station. As it is raw data, sometimes it will be more of a comment than an address.
position                    position.py   - position: position of the station in WGS84 format -  attributes: lat,lng
banking                     boolean       - banking: indicates whether this station has a payment terminal
bonus                       boolean       - bonus: indicates whether this is a bonus station

Dynamic data:
status                      string        - status: indicates whether this station is CLOSED or OPEN
bike_stands                 integer       - bike_stands: the number of operational bike stands at this station
available_bike_stands       integer       - available_bike_stands: the number of available bike stands at this station
available_bikes             integer       - available_bikes: the number of available and operational bikes at this station
last_update                 string        - last_update: timestamp indicating the last update time in milliseconds since Epoch
