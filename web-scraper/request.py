REQUEST.PY
The request.py fetches the data from JCDecaux. It gets the list of stations, 
the data returned from this function is an array in json format.

DATA FORMAT STATION DATA
Here is an example of the data that the station returns:
{
"number": 123,
"contract_name" : "Lyon",
"name": "stations name",
"address": "address of the station",
"position": {
   "lat": 45.774204,
   "lng": 4.867512
   },
   "banking": true,
   "bonus": false,
   "status": "OPEN",
   "bike_stands": 20,
   "available_bike_stands": 15,
   "available_bikes": 5,
   "last_update": <timestamp>
 }
 
Here is an example how we could use the functions to get the data:
           stations = get_stations()   # returns a list of stations
           for station in stations:    # iterates over each station in the station ist
               station['id]            # gets the id of a station
               station['name']         # gets the name of a station

DATA FORMAT CONTRACT DATA
The get_contracts function returns an array of json data which has format like below:
{
   "name" : "Lyon",
   "commercial_name" : "VÃ©lo'v",
   "country_code" : "FR",
   "cities" : [
     "Lyon",
     "Villeurbanne",
   ]
 }
 Usage:
               contracts = get_contracts()         # return a list of contracts
               for contract in contracts:          # iterate each contract in the contracts
                   contract['name']                # get the name of a contract
                   contract['country_code']        # get the country code of a contract
